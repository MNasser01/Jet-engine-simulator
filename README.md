# Jet-engine-simulator
this is a comprehensive, MATLAB-based simulation environment designed to analyze and visualize the aero-thermodynamic performance of a turbojet engine. Developed after two months of intensive study in aircraft propulsion, this project bridges the gap between theoretical Brayton Cycle equations and real-time engineering visualization.
